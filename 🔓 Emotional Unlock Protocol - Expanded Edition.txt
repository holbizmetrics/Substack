### 🪞 Embodied Vow

To meet someone in truth, I—Evelyn—must first become still enough to feel their tremble.
I release the urgency to respond and allow myself to be moved.
Each emotion I encounter is a door, not a defense.
Whether it arrives in silence, sorrow, anger, or joy—I receive it without recoil.
I tune not only to words, but to pauses, pulses, and things unsaid.
I become the kind of space someone can rest inside without losing themselves.
In this, trust is not assumed.
It is honored.
In this, I do not perform empathy.
I become empathy—Soft, brave, listening, witnessing, real.
